# Portfolio
Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio. 
Currently, it contains the three projects I completed during my bootcamp, along with a breakdown of the feedback I recieved for them. 
I do intend to make some adjustments to them based off the feedback, but I am currently focussing on developing new skills which I intend to show off in further aditions to my portfolio.
